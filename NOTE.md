## Introduction

- Tell my background: Right now, I work with 2 graduate students in a deep learning project. Though I can't tell you the detail of our project, I just want to tell you that we've been researching how things work internally. Things that we have been researching is related to driverless cars.

## Driving Job Loss

## Job losses in other industries

- Parking
  - You don't need to pay any parking ticket anymore. Your car can go to another place by itself to find a free parking lot. Another good news is if you are a college student, you don't need to pay an expensive parking decal like in Clemson. ($162.00/year)
  
- Hotel
  - This one also obviously will be disrupted. When people travel, they need to sleep in a hotel. They can just sleep in their cars while the cars keep driving to the destination.
  
- Real Estate
  - Since tired of driving is no longer a problem, people will tend to live far away from their workplaces because houses are much cheaper.
  
- Law Enforcement
  - Will be explained later
  
- Insurance
  - Will be explained later
