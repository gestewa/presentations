## Introduction

- Tell my background: Right now, I work with 2 graduate students in a deep learning project. Though I can't tell you the detail of our project, I just want to tell you that we've been researching how things work internally. Things that we have been researching is related to driverless cars.

## Driving Job Loss

## Job losses in other industries

- Parking
  - You don't need to pay any parking ticket anymore. Your car can go to another place by itself to find a free parking lot. Another good news is if you are a college student, you don't need to pay an expensive parking decal like in Clemson. ($162.00/year)
  
- Hotel
  - This one also obviously will be disrupted. When people travel, they need to sleep in a hotel. They can just sleep in their cars while the cars keep driving to the destination.
  
- Real Estate
  - Since tired of driving is no longer a problem, people will tend to live far away from their workplaces because houses are much cheaper.
  
- Law Enforcement
  - Will be explained later
  
- Insurance
  - Will be explained later
  
 ## Trolley Problem
 
 - This ethical dilemma is the most common issue we're having.
 - Let's say you're driving on a hill and your brake is not working. Then, you only have 2 choices: turn your car to an old couple or to a child.
 
## Technology will never be perfect

- Based on my experience, driverless cars will not have a perfect accuracy. There is a definite probability that the cars will crash.
- And this is not only from my opinion, but also from other experts. Early in this year, I went to an nvidia conference that is talking about driverless cars. Their company is now also doing a research in driverless cars. The car they introduced in that conference was BB8.
- After the conference ended, I had an opportunity to talk in person to one of the engineers. I asked him about the cars' accuracy. He told me, "The accuracy will not be 100%. That's for sure." Then, I asked him, "But, you programmed it. You should be able to debug it." Then, he replied me, "To be honest, I don't even know how the program will work. What we do is just doing some experiments. If the result is good then good. If it is bad then we have to change something."
- Now, after I've done some research in this area, what he said was true. 

## Black Box Problem

- Until now, we still can't crack the "black box." This problem is still a big area of research.
- Moreover, we still even don't know why this technique can be successful.

## Conclusion

- Can you trust your car if there is a definite possibility that it will crash and potentially kill you?
