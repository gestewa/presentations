### History 
- since 1970
- too expensive for large scale until recently
- tracked:
    -  cows
    -  railroad cars 
    -  airline luggage

### Technology

 - often 2 kilobytes of data 
 - composed of 
     - microchip
     - antenna
     - battery (sometimes)

---

### accessible and popularized
 - toll passcards
 - subway passes

---

### less expensive to produce
 - Passive
     - 20 ft
     - 7 - 10 cents
     - objective = 5 cents

### Department of State & Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
 - issuing electronic passports
 - digital signature 
 - photograph
 - biometric identifier

---
## Hackers
- have proven that some RFID tags can be tampered with, including disabling their anti-theft features and changing the price that corresponds to their product
---
### Skimming: 
when someone uses an RFID reader to scan data from an RFID chip without the e-passport holder's knowledge.

---
### NFC chips
 -  tapped against instead of swiped fix skimming problem

---

### Eavesdropping: 
 - when someone reads the frequencies emitted from the RFID chip as it is scanned by an official reader.

### Animal chipping for pets

### Human chipping
- emergency contact information and medical histories
    - Alzheimer's

<img src="images/image2.jpg" height="550">
---
### Babies 
   - kidnapping
   - SIDS
--- 
### "The [store] shelves themselves will communicate wirelessly with the network"

---
### Will human chipping become mandatory? 

### Would you entrust your medical history to an RFID tag?

### How about your home address or your baby's safety?
